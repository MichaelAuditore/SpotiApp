# Spotify API token

Always before to run the application you must change the TOKEN provided in file [spotify.service.ts](src/app/services/spotify.service.ts) just replace the token property with your Token and that's all

# Why token doesn't automatically generated?

It's because only servers are able to do requests to get Spotify OAuth Token
